        <h3>Breif br tag explanation</h3>
        <p>
            Allows us to insert a break line inside text. Useful for poem or song as texts.
            However it's a bad practice to use them as interline-spacing, so you must use css attribute as margin.

        <h4>Example without br tag: Led Zeppeling - Stairway </h4>
        <p>
            There's a lady who's sure
            All that glitters is gold
            And she's buying a stairway to heaven
            When she gets there she knows
            If the stores are all closed
            With a word she can get what she came for
            Oh oh oh oh and she's buying a stairway to heaven

            <h3>URI</h3>
            <p>A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters that unambiguously identifies a particular
                resource. To guarantee uniformity, all URIs follow a predefined set of syntax rules,[1] but also
                maintain extensibility through a separately defined hierarchical naming scheme</p>

        <section id="url-section">
            <h3>URL</h3>
            <p>A Uniform Resource Locator (URL), colloquially termed a web address,[1] is a reference to a web resource
                that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific
                type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI),[2][3] although many people use the two terms
                interchangeably.[4][a] URLs occur most commonly to reference web pages (http), but are also used for
                file transfer (ftp), email (mailto), database access (JDBC), and many other applications.

                languages such as JavaScript.
