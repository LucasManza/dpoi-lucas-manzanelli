                <h3>Breif br tag explanation</h3>
                <p>
                    Allows us to insert a break line inside text. Useful for poem or song as texts.
                    However it's a bad practice to use them as interline-spacing, so you must use css attribute as
                    margin.

                    There's a lady who's sure
                    All that glitters is gold
                    And she's buying a stairway to heaven
                    When she gets there she knows
                    If the stores are all closed
                    With a word she can get what she came for
                    Oh oh oh oh and she's buying a stairway to heaven

                    <p>A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters that unambiguously identifies a
                        particular
                        resource. To guarantee uniformity, all URIs follow a predefined set of syntax rules,[1] but also
                        maintain extensibility through a separately defined hierarchical naming scheme</p>

                    <h3>URL</h3>
                    <p>A Uniform Resource Locator (URL), colloquially termed a web address,[1] is a reference to a web
                        resource
                        that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a
                        specific
                        type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI),[2][3] although many people use the two terms
                        interchangeably.[4][a] URLs occur most commonly to reference web pages (http), but are also used
                        for
                        file transfer (ftp), email (mailto), database access (JDBC), and many other applications.
